## Function Declaration

A function declaration consists of: 

* the `function` keyword
* the name of the `function`, or its identifier, followed by parenthesis
* A function `body`, or a block of satements required to perform a specific task, enclosed in curly brackets `{ }`


```js
function greetWorld() {
	console.log('Hello, World');
}
```



## Calling a function

A function declaration binds a function to an identifier, it does not ask the code inside the function body to run, in order to run / execute, it needs to be  __*called.

To call a function you type the function name followed by parenthesis:

```js
greetworld();
```
